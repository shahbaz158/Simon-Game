# Simon-Game
The Simon game is a classic memory game where the player has to repeat a sequence of colored buttons that light up and make a sound. The game starts with a short sequence, and each round, the sequence gets longer and more complex. The player loses if they miss a button or if they take too long to press the buttons.
